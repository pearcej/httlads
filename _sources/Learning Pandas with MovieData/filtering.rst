Filtering the Data
==================

Let’s start by only looking at films that cost over a million dollars to make.

Create a variable called ``budget_df`` that contains all columns for the movies
whose budget was over a million dollars.


.. code:: python3

   budget_df = []
   budget_df.shape


.. fillintheblank:: mov_expensive_movies

   How many movies have a budget over 1 million dollars? |blank|

   - :7208: Is the correct answer
     :7405: Budget should be over (not including) 1 million dollars
     :x: catchall feedback


With this more manageable list of 7000+ movies, I’d like to have a way to look
up the budget of a particular movie.

Create a Series object called ``budget_lookup`` such that you are able to use a
call to ``budget_lookup['Dead Presidents']`` to find the budget of that movie.


.. code:: python3

   budget_lookup = []
   budget_lookup['Dead Presidents']


.. fillintheblank:: mov_dead_presidents_budget

   What was the budget for Dead Presidents? |blank|

   - :10000000: Is the correct answer
     :x: catchall feedback


I have figured out that the first (alphabetically) movie whose title starts with
an "A" is "A Bag of Hammers" and the last movie that starts with a "B" is
"Byzantium".


.. code:: python3

   budget_lookup[budget_lookup.index.str.startswith('A')].sort_index()[[0]]


.. parsed-literal::

   title
   A Bag of Hammers    2000000
   dtype: int64


.. code:: python3

   budget_lookup[budget_lookup.index.str.startswith('B')].sort_index()[[-1]]


.. parsed-literal::

   title
   Byzantium    10000000
   dtype: int64


Use that knowledge to create a series that contains budget informations for all
the movies that start with an "A" or a "B". **Hint:** No need to use
``startswith`` like I did above, just use the movie titles to do a slice.


.. code:: python3

   budget_lookup_as_and_bs = []
   budget_lookup_as_and_bs.shape


.. fillintheblank:: mov_a_b_movies

   How many movies with a budget of over a million dollars and whose title
   starts with an "A" or a "B" are there?

   - :933: Is the correct answer
